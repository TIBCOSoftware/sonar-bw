This is a ***Process*** rule - the rule will test each process of the application

Unit Testing is a critical part of any development software. We should leverage of the out of the box unit testing capabilities TIBCO BusinessWorksâ„¢ has to make sure our developments are working and also to ease the process to any evolution of the process without breaking the old behavior or add unexpected bugs

## How to fix it?

Define Unit Test Cases for each of the process inside your development

## How do I use this rule?

The rule is **_enabled_** by default. To disable it if unwanted, clone the default "**`BW6 Quality Profile`**" quality profile and then disable the rule.
