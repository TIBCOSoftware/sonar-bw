# NumberOfPropertiesSameGroup

## What condition does this detect?

Check the maximum of module properties that you should have together in the same group to ensure a proper and maintable property organization

This is an ***Application*** rule - the rule will test for some condition within the application

## Why is this condition important?

Readability and maintenance is a characteristic that not only applies to the design of the process itself but also to all the components that are part of the development. And that includes the management of the properties. BusinessWorksâ„¢ has the option to define different groups to be able to group and categorize the different properties and if we managed those properties well is more easy to understand the purpose of each of those and at the end contribute to increase the readability of the whole process

## How to fix it?

Group the properties in smaller functional groups to increase the readability of the whole project

## How do I use this rule?

The rule is **_enabled_** by default. To disable it if unwanted, clone the default "**`BW6 Quality Profile`**" quality profile and then disable the rule.
