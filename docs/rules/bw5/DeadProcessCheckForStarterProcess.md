# DeadProcessCheckForStarterProcess

## What condition does this detect?

Check the unused starter process( Dead Code).

This is a ***Process*** rule - the rule will test each process of the application

## Why is this condition important?

This check ensure the maintenability of your project but ensuring that it doesn't include starter processes that are not part of any of the archives. Because of that helps to keep current the source code with the piece that is deployed in the different environments

## How to fix it?

Remove any unused starter process that is not part of any archive file

## How do I use this rule?

The rule is **_enabled_** by default. To disable it if unwanted, clone the default "**`BW5 Quality Profile`**" quality profile and then disable the rule.
