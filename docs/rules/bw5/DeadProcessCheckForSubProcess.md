# DeadProcessCheckForSubProcess

## What condition does this detect?

Check the unused sub process( Dead Code).

This is a ***Process*** rule - the rule will test each process of the application

## Why is this condition important?

This check allows to identify dead code by using subprocess that are not being reference by any other process.

## How to fix it?

Remove unused subprocess to ensure the project is kept at the minimum number of resources

## How do I use this rule?

The rule is **_enabled_** by default. To disable it if unwanted, clone the default "**`BW5 Quality Profile`**" quality profile and then disable the rule.
