<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>Check if most that one XML Schema or WSDL file have same target namespace</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   Namespace is part of the XML schema definition and it should be used to define the scope of the definition of the components inside it. Using the same namespaces for different XML components is a bad practice and should be avoided to make sure that each XML Resource has its own namespace
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Provide a unique XML namespace for each XML resource inside the project</p>
