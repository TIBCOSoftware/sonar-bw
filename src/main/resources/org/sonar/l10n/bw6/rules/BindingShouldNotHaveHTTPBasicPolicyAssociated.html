<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>To ensure that the communications are authentified all input connections should check that the binding has a policy associated that is secure</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   Nowadays is not only important to create code that works but also code that is secure. Because of that is mandatory to provide some kind of authentication technique to be able to not allow anyone from the outside to call our service and generate a security breach. Additional to that there are some authentication methods that are not considered secured anymore. Methods like HTTP Basic Authentication is no longer considered a secure way to do it as it doesn't provide any encryption about how the credentials are being sent
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Change the Authentication method from Basic Authentication to another more secured</p>
