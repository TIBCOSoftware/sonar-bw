<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks all flows are finished properly using an end activity </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
    For a mainteance perspective and to clear the process design is important that all the flows are finalized with an end activity. That means that is more understandable that the logic ends here by purpose, instead of just having the last functional activity as part of the flow.
    When we talk about End activities we're talking about the following ones: End, Reply, Exit, Throw or Rethrow.
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Review your process design to make sure that all the flows are ened with one of the end activities shown above</p>
