<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks if process namespace is the default one generated by the tool.</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>Namespaces has an important role to play in the XML world. Based on their definition inside the W3C standard: XML namespaces provide a simple method for qualifying element and attribute names used in Extensible Markup Language documents by associating them with namespaces identified by IRI references.</p>
<p>That means that we should provide a conscient name for each of the namespaces we're using in our development. We usually do that with the schemas we use for the payload data that we're managing. But we shouldn't forget that our own BW Process also are XML that needs to be handled in the same way. So we should define a namespace strategy for our process and make sure we're following it.</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>To change the namespace of an specific process, we should need to go to the Properties view of the process and in the Advance tab change the namespace for the process. This should be done as soon as we create the process to make sure no other references for that the old namespaces are kept in other processes</p>
