<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>JMS Connector should have set confidentiality settings </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   Nowadays is not only important to create code that works but also code that is secure. Because of that is mandatory to provide some kind of confidentiality technique to be able to not allow anyone from the outside to call our service and generate a security breach. That's why we should use SSL as part of our JMS communications
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Add confidentiality options to the JMS connector resource we have inside our project</p>
