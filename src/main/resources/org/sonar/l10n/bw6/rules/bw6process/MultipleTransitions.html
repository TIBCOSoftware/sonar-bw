<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks whether multiple transitions from an activity in a parallel flow merge into EMPTY activity</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   EMPTY activity should be used if you want to join multiple transition flows. For example, there are multiple transitions out of an activity and each transition takes a different path in the process. In this scenario you can create a transition from the activity at the end of each path to an Empty activity to resume a single flow of execution in the process.

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Review your process design for merging flows without an Empty activity and to ease the readability and maintenance of the process add a Empty activity to just merge those flows</p>
