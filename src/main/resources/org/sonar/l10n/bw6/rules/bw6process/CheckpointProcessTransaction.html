<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. Do not place checkpoint within or in parallel to a Transaction Group or a Critical Section Group. Checkpoint activities should be placed at points that are guaranteed to be reached before or after the transaction group is reached.</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

If the checkpoint is applied after and the instance crashes at some point after receiving the request, they try to recover from that point and when it tries to respond to the requestor it will fail because it is not going to be present and the socket is not going to be available to use it.

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>In your developments try to do a design that  require an stateless approach to be able to dont need the presence of any Checkpoint activity to store the status of the instance at that particular point.</p>
<p>In case you have the need or the requirement to use it try to do it </p>
