<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks whether JDBC activities are using wildcards in the query. As a good coding practice, never use wildcards in JDBC queries.</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>Wildcard like * in a JDBC query is not a good practice because you're not specificing your output interface with the database. If the database in a progressive change like adding new files and so on you can be affected, so your code is less reliable and robust as it should be.</p>
<p>Also for a performance perspective it is also a bad practice, because you should only ask for the fields that you need and probably this will be a subset of all the fields that are in the database table</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Change the configuration of the queries that you use in your JDBC Queries to change the * for the name of the fields that you're looking for and you need.</p>
