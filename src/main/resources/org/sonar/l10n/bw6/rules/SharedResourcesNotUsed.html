<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>"Shared Resource not used</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   Sometimes when we work and evolve several times the same projects we probably change some components and another ones are not needed anymore. That usually happens when we change protocols or resources that can be kepts forever as part of the project even if they're not needed anymore. That work against the readability and maintenability of the project itself.
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Remove the unused shared resources to increase the readability of the project</p>
