<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>SSLClient Connector should use recommended TLS protocol to secure all communications between a client and a server</p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   Nowadays is not only important to create code that works but also code that is secure. Because of that is mandatory to provide some kind of confidentiality technique to be able to not allow anyone from the outside to call our service and generate a security breach. That's why we should use SSL as part of our HTTP communications but also we should use the SSL version that are considered secure at this point in time
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Upgrade the level of SSL used to the considered secure today (TLS 1.0 or higher)</p>
