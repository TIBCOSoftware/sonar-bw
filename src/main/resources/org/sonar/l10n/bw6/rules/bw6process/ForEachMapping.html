<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks the Input mappings of activities. In activity Input mapping for performance reasons, it is recommended ato use Copy-Of instead of For-Each whenever possible. </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>copy-of  clause are much more performant rather a loop iteration from the root element and also it requires less memory to compute.</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Check if you have available the copy-of when you're doing the mapping from your component to the target one to use the most efficient mapping solution</p>
