<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks for inefficiencies on using ParseXML activities using RenderXML activity output   </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   This rule checks for inefficiencies on using ParseXML activities using RenderXML activity output  as input when it should rely on Coertion to do same job. If we have a RenderXML activity output  that because we have a known structure first with a Node so it was already parsed, so going from Parsed --> Text --> Parsed is inefficient and it should be avoided. You will get more performance and better readability of the process as we are removing some activities as well
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Change your process design to avoid using ParseXML using a RenderXML activity output  as the input of it and change it for a coertion on the next activity that you need that data to</p>
