   Security is a key aspect of today developments, and that implies not only that we use the secure practices but also that the secure components that we use to set up these practices should also being secured. In terms of the JKS that we have inside our development that implies that the certificates stored inside are still valid so they're not expired. And also that those certificates are not autosigned
