<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks if there is no parallel flows with JDBC activities inside a Transaction Group </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>Parallel flows inside a JDBC Transaction Group will not be executed so the  output of the whole Transaction Group could be unexpected</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Change the design of your JDBC Transaction Group to remove the need for the Parallel configuration </p>
