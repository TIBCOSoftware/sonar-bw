<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. Do not place checkpoint after or in a parallel flow of Query activities or idempotent activities. Database operations such as Update, Insert and Delete are considered non-idempotent operations. You should always place a checkpoint immediately after any database insert or update activity to persist the response. However, for queries, there is no need to place checkpoints. </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

If the checkpoint is applied after and the instance crashes at some point after receiving the request, they try to recover from that point and when it tries to respond to the requestor it will fail because it is not going to be present and the socket is not going to be available to use it.

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>In your developments try to do a design that  require an stateless approach to be able to dont need the presence of any Checkpoint activity to store the status of the instance at that particular point.</p>
<p>In case you have the need or the requirement to use it try to do it on process that they don't require  </p>
