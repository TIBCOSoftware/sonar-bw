<h3>Basic Description</h3>

<p>RenderXML should use binary mode for performance assestment  </p>

<h3>Why this is important?</h3>

<p>
   RenderXML activities supports text and binary mode, but for performance reasons the binary mode is much more performance than the text one. So try to rely on the binary mode to increase the performance of your processes.
</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Change the RenderXML configuration to use the binary mode and also the component that is feeding the data to the activity to work on the binary mode</p>
